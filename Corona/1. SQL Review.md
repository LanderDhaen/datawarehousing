## SELECT, WHERE, JOIN, GROUP BY, ORDER BY & Statistical Functions

1. How many countries can be found in the dataset?

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS 'Countries'
FROM Countries
```

2. Give the total population per continent.

```sql
SELECT c.continent, SUM(CONVERT(bigint, c.population)) AS 'Population'
FROM Countries c
GROUP BY c.continent
```

3. Which country with more than 1 000 000 inhabitants, has the highest life expectancy?

```sql
SELECT TOP 1 c.country
FROM Countries c
WHERE c.population > 1000000
ORDER BY c.life_expectancy DESC
```

4. Calculate the average life_expectancy for each continent, take into account the population for each country.

```sql
SELECT c.continent, SUM(CONVERT(bigint, c.population) * c.life_expectancy)/SUM(CONVERT(bigint, c.population)) AS 'Average life expectancy'
FROM Countries c
GROUP BY c.continent
```

```sql
SELECT c.continent, SUM(c.population * c.life_expectancy * 1.0)/SUM(c.population * 1.0) AS 'Average life expectancy'
FROM Countries c
GROUP BY c.continent
```

5. Give the country with the highest number of Corona deaths.

```sql
SELECT TOP 1 cd.country, SUM(cd.new_deaths) AS 'Total Deaths'
FROM CovidData cd
JOIN Countries c ON cd.iso_code = c.iso_code
GROUP BY cd.country
ORDER BY SUM(cd.new_deaths) DESC
```

6. On which day was 50% of the Belgians fully vaccinated?

```sql
SELECT MIN(cd.report_date) AS 'Report Date'
FROM CovidData cd
JOIN Countries c ON cd.iso_code = c.iso_code
WHERE c.country = 'Belgium'
AND cd.people_fully_vaccinated >= (c.population / 2)
```

7. On which day the first Belgian received a vaccin?

```sql
SELECT TOP 1 report_date
FROM CovidData cd
JOIN Countries c ON c.iso_code = cd.iso_code
WHERE c.country = 'Belgium' AND people_fully_vaccinated IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY people_fully_vaccinated ASC;
```

8. On which day the first Corona death was reported in Europe?

```sql
SELECT TOP 1 cd.report_date
FROM CovidData cd
JOIN Countries c ON cd.iso_code = c.iso_code
WHERE c.continent = 'Europe'
AND cd.total_deaths IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY cd.report_date ASC
```

9. What is the estimated total amount of smokers in Belgium? Subtract 2 000 000 children from the total Belgian population.

```sql
SELECT ((c.female_smokers + c.male_smokers) / 100) * (c.population - 2000000) AS 'Smokers'
FROM Countries c
WHERE c.country = 'Belgium';
```

10. The first lockdown in Belgium started on 18 march 2020. Give all the data until 21 days afterwards to be able to check if the lockdown had any effect.

```sql
SELECT TOP 22 *
FROM CovidData cd
WHERE cd.country = 'Belgium'
AND cd.report_date >= '2020/03/18'
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM CovidData cd
WHERE cd.country = 'Belgium'
AND cd.report_date BETWEEN '2020/03/18' AND DATEADD(day, 21,'2020/03/18');
```

11. In which month (month + year) the number of deaths was the highest in Belgium?

```sql
SELECT TOP 1 SUM(cd.new_deaths) AS 'Deaths', MONTH(cd.report_date) AS 'Month', YEAR(cd.report_date) AS 'Year'
FROM CovidData cd
JOIN Countries c ON cd.iso_code = c.iso_code
WHERE c.country = 'Belgium'
GROUP BY MONTH(cd.report_date), YEAR(cd.report_date)
ORDER BY SUM(cd.new_deaths) DESC
```
