## SELECT, WHERE, JOIN, GROUP BY, ORDER BY & Statistical Functions

1. There are how many different musical Styles?

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT ms.StyleID) AS 'Music styles'
FROM Musical_Styles ms
```

2. What is the number of available entertainers per style?

```sql
SELECT ms.StyleID, ms.StyleName, COUNT(es.StyleID) AS 'Entertainers'
FROM Musical_Styles ms
JOIN Entertainer_Styles es ON ms.StyleID = es.StyleID
GROUP BY ms.StyleID, ms.StyleName
```

3. What are the members that belong to more than 1 entertainer?

```sql
SELECT m.MemberID, m.MbrFirstName + ' ' + m.MbrLastName AS 'Name', COUNT(DISTINCT em.MemberID) AS 'Entertainers'
FROM Members m
JOIN Entertainer_Members em ON m.MemberID = em.MemberID
GROUP BY m.MemberID, m.MbrFirstName, m.MbrLastName
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT em.MemberID) > 1
```

4. What is the number of engagementsper year and per entertainer? Use StartDate to determine the year. Order on the number of engagements in descending way.

```sql
SELECT eng.EntertainerID, YEAR(eng.StartDate) AS 'Year', COUNT(eng.EngagementNumber) AS 'Engagements'
FROM Engagements eng
GROUP BY eng.EntertainerID, YEAR(eng.StartDate)
ORDER BY COUNT(eng.EngagementNumber) DESC
```

5. What is the total revenue for each entertainer per year? Use contractprice to calculate the revenue. Order on the total revenue in descending way. The imagebelow shows only a part of the resultset.

```sql
SELECT eng.EntertainerID, YEAR(eng.StartDate) AS 'Year', SUM(eng.ContractPrice) AS 'Revenue'
FROM Engagements eng
GROUP BY eng.EntertainerID, YEAR(eng.StartDate)
ORDER BY SUM(eng.ContractPrice) DESC
```

6. How many entertainers were entered per year? Order by year in ascending way.

```sql
SELECT YEAR(e.DateEntered) AS 'Year', COUNT(DISTINCT e.EntertainerID) AS 'New entertainers'
FROM Entertainers e
GROUP BY YEAR(e.DateEntered)
ORDER BY YEAR(e.DateEntered) ASC
```

7. Give for each agent the total income per year. An agent has a salary and a commission on the contractprice. Round the result to 2 decimals.

```sql
SELECT a.AgentID, a.AgtFirstName + ' ' + a.AgtLastName AS 'Name', YEAR(eng.StartDate) AS 'Year', ROUND(SUM(a.CommissionRate * eng.ContractPrice) + a.Salary,2)  AS 'Income'
FROM Agents a
INNER JOIN Engagements eng ON a.AgentID = eng.AgentID
GROUP BY a.AgentID, a.AgtFirstName, a.AgtLastName, YEAR(eng.StartDate), a.Salary
```

8. What isthe number of male and female entertainers.

```sql
SELECT m.Gender, COUNT(*) AS 'Members'
FROM Members m
GROUP BY m.Gender
```

9. Gender = NULL is perhaps an entertainer that didn't want to reveal his gender. Replace NULL with X

```sql
SELECT ISNULL(m.Gender, 'X') AS 'Gender', COUNT(*) AS 'Members'
FROM Members m
GROUP BY m.Gender
```

10. What is the average number of members per entertainer per musical style. Only take into account StyleStrength = 1. Order by the average number of members in descending way.

```sql
SELECT es.StyleID, ms.StyleName, COUNT(em.MemberID) / COUNT(DISTINCT es.EntertainerID) As 'Average members'
FROM Entertainer_Styles es
JOIN Entertainer_Members em ON es.EntertainerID = em.EntertainerID
JOIN Musical_Styles ms ON es.StyleID = ms.StyleID
WHERE es.StyleStrength = 1
GROUP BY es.StyleID, ms.StyleName
ORDER BY COUNT(em.MemberID) / COUNT(DISTINCT es.EntertainerID) DESC
```

11. What is number of entertainers each agent already worked with?

```sql
SELECT a.AgentID, a.AgtFirstName + ' ' + a.AgtLastName AS 'Name', COUNT(DISTINCT eng.EntertainerID) AS 'Entertainers'
FROM Agents a
JOIN Engagements eng ON a.AgentID = eng.AgentID
GROUP BY a.AgentID, a.AgtFirstName, a.AgtLastName
```

12. What is number of agents each entertainer already worked with?

```sql
SELECT e.EntertainerID, e.EntStageName, COUNT(DISTINCT eng.AgentID) AS 'Agents'
FROM Entertainers e
JOIN Engagements eng ON e.EntertainerID = eng.EntertainerID
GROUP BY e.EntertainerID, e.EntStageName
```

13. What are the engagements for which the contractprice is 50% more expensive than the number of days \* EntPricePerDay?

```sql
SELECT eng.EngagementNumber, eng.ContractPrice, (DATEDIFF(DAY, eng.StartDate, eng.EndDate) + 1) * e.EntPricePerDay AS 'Calculated on daily rate'
FROM Engagements eng
JOIN Entertainers e ON eng.EntertainerID = e.EntertainerID
WHERE eng.ContractPrice > 1.5 * ((DATEDIFF(DAY, eng.StartDate, eng.EndDate) + 1) * e.EntPricePerDay)
```

14. What is the average price per musical style based on EntPricePerDay. Only take into account StyleStrength = 1. Order by average price in descending way.

```sql
SELECT ms.StyleID, ms.StyleName, AVG(e.EntPricePerDay) AS 'Average daily rate'
FROM Entertainers e
JOIN Entertainer_Styles es ON e.EntertainerID = es.EntertainerID
JOIN Musical_Styles ms ON es.StyleID = ms.StyleID
WHERE es.StyleStrength = 1
GROUP BY ms.StyleID, ms.StyleName
ORDER BY AVG(e.EntPricePerDay) DESC
```

15. What are the music styles for which we don't have any entertainer available in the database?

```sql
SELECT ms.StyleID, ms.StyleName
FROM Musical_Styles ms
LEFT JOIN Entertainer_Styles es ON ms.StyleID = es.StyleID
WHERE es.StyleStrength IS NULL
```
